            <p>This section contains reports on various aspects of the website.</p>
            <p>The site report for Amit's Portfolio indicates that the website is currently private and inaccessible to
                the public. Consequently, there have been no visitors, page views, or activity recorded. Detailed
                performance metrics such as average page load time and server response time are not available due to the
                site's private status. Similarly, SEO-related data, including keyword rankings and backlink profiles,
                cannot be assessed as the website has not been indexed by search engines or established any backlinks.
                Security measures such as SSL certificates and firewalls are not applicable at this stage, and there
                have been no reported security incidents. With regard to content, no new content has been added, and
                content performance cannot be evaluated. User feedback, technical updates, and financial data are also
                not applicable as the website remains private with no public access or activity. </p>
