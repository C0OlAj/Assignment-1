            <p>Developing my portfolio website over 3-4 weeks was an enriching experience that involved learning HTML
                and CSS, and managing code with Git/GitHub. The project began with basic web development knowledge and
                evolved through hands-on practice and debugging, emphasizing the importance of patience. The design was
                inspired by professional portfolios, focusing on a clean, minimalist aesthetic for readability and
                user-friendliness. Challenges like creating a responsive design were overcome using CSS media queries,
                and mastering Git/GitHub for version control was initially daunting but ultimately invaluable. This
                journey not only honed my web development skills but also instilled a sense of pride in my work and a
                drive to continue improving as a developer. </p>
