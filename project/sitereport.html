            <h1>Site Report</h1>
            <p>This section contains reports on various aspects of the website.</p>
            <h2>Project Timeline</h2>
            <p>The portfolio website was developed over a span of 3-4 weeks. This timeline allowed for a steady
                progression from basic web development knowledge to more advanced concepts, with plenty of time for
                hands-on practice and debugging.</p>

            <h2>Learning Experience</h2>
            <p>The project served as a comprehensive learning experience, involving the acquisition of new skills in
                HTML and CSS, as well as the management of code with Git/GitHub. This not only provided practical coding
                experience but also emphasized the importance of patience and perseverance in the face of challenges.
            </p>

            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
            <p>The design of the website was inspired by professional portfolios, with a focus on a clean, minimalist
                aesthetic. This approach was chosen to enhance readability and user-friendliness, ensuring that visitors
                to the site can easily navigate and find the information they're looking for.</p>

            <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
            <p>The development process presented several technical challenges. One of the main challenges was creating a
                responsive design that would look good on screens of all sizes. This was achieved using CSS media
                queries. Another significant challenge was mastering Git/GitHub for version control. While initially
                daunting, this skill proved to be invaluable for managing different versions of the project and
                collaborating with others.</p>

            <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
            <p>The journey of developing this portfolio website not only honed web development skills but also instilled
                a sense of pride in the work and a drive to continue improving as a developer. It served as a reminder
                that every challenge overcome is a step forward in the journey of learning and growth.</p>
